    features of yamlos such that theses features can be evaluated by unittests.

      - Class1:
          # Note: utc_ means unit test comment; The tests will assure that this string is present
          SubClassOf: "owl:Thing"
          annotations: "This is a single annotation. Will be converted to a len-1 list. utc_annotation"
      - Class2:
          SubClassOf: "owl:Thing"
